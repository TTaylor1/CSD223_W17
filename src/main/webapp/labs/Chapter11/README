Chapter 11 requires you to write a php app.
Clone it from http://10.40.40.94/fcarella/Chapter11_git.git

Students need to install xampp and then create a Netbeans based PHP project in the
    e:\xampp\htdocs
folder (or wherever they installed xampp.  You can copy the above cloned project into this folder)

My project is called
E:\xampp\htdocs\Chapter11

Notes**
- solar.htm executes script.js which uses the server as a proxy to get the data 
from forecast.io

- solar_using_jsonp.htm was added by me and executes scriptJSONP.js which gets the data from 
forecast.io directly without the need of a proxy.
